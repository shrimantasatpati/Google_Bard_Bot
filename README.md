# Google_Bard_Bot 

Welcome to the **Google Bard Bot** project! A chat interface in Gradio seamlessly interact with 🤖 **Google Bard**, a remarkable conversational AI developed by Google.

## Getting Started 🚀

Let's embark on a journey to set up and launch the project on your local machine for developmental and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites 📋

Before we dive in, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.11 or newer 🐍

### Installation 🛠️

1. Begin by cloning the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ra83205/google-bard-api.git
    cd google-bard-api
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and install the necessary packages:

    ```sh
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Launch the application on localhost:

    Your application should now be live at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Usage 📦

To utilize the power of the Google Bard API, follow these steps:

1. Obtain the cookies as mentioned on **bard.google.com** from an authorized session. These cookies will be used to send POST requests to the `/ask` endpoint, accompanied by a message in a JSON payload. Make sure to include the `session_id`, which corresponds to the `__Secure-1PSID` cookie, in your request.

2. Example request using cURL:

    ```sh
    curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/ask" -H "accept: application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"session_id":"your-session-id","message":"What is the meaning of life?"}'
    ```

3. Example request using Postman:

    - Open Postman and choose the "POST" method
    - Enter the URL: `http://localhost:8000/ask`
    - In the "Headers" tab, add a new key-value pair: `Content-Type: application/json`
    - In the "Body" tab, select the "raw" option and input the following JSON payload:

        ```json
        {
          "session_id": "your-session-id",
          "message": "What is the meaning of life?"
        }
        ```

    - Click "Send" to submit the request. You'll receive a JSON response from Google Bard containing the response message.

    > **Note**: To secure the `/ask` endpoint with an authentication key, set the `USER_AUTH_KEY` environment variable to a string value of your choice. The authentication key will be cross-referenced against the `Authorization` header of incoming requests.

## Deployment 🚢

To deploy this application using Docker, embark on the following steps:

1. Construct the Docker image:

    ```sh
    docker build -t your-image-name .
    ```

2. Initiate the Docker container:

    ```sh
    docker run -p 8000:80 your-image-name
    ```

    The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
